# API Laboratories

<h4>Laboratory 1: Simple Factorial API</h4> This is a simple API built using FastAPI that calculates the factorial of a given number. The API accepts an integer as input and returns the factorial of that number.

<h4>Labratory 2:</h4> I created a simple API in this laboratory using FastAPI to manage tasks. This API allows you to create new tasks, view existing ones, update them, and delete them. The tasks are stored in memory, and the API checks if the data is correct, providing clear error messages if something goes wrong. Itâ€™s a basic tool I built to help manage tasks in an easy and organized way.

<b>Laboratory 3</b>:In this activity, I worked with an external API to fetch and manipulate data. I learned how to retrieve data from APIs, process it using Python, and return the results in a valid JSON format. The goal was to create an API that combines multiple external APIs, formats the data as required, and returns it to the user.

For example, I created endpoints that return posts and comments from a placeholder API, format them based on specific criteria (like user ID), and combine them in meaningful ways. One of the tasks was to create a detailed post API that shows all posts of a user along with comments for each post.

By doing this, I gained experience with:

Fetching and manipulating data from external APIs
Formatting and returning data in JSON format
Combining different API calls into a single API
This exercise helped me understand how to work with data from multiple sources and create an API that returns comprehensive and structured information to the user.
